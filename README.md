# Health-Care-Notifier-System
This is a Health Care Notifier system which sends notifications and voice notes to remind you to drink water and do exercise etc.
You can use this to take care of your health because in most of the cases almost every software engineer forgets to drink water and stop taking break between work.

# Pros and Cons of using this program.
## Pros:- 
- You will be notified over the period of time.
- You habbit of drinking water and taking break while work will develop.

## Cons:-
- This program can be so irritatefull because regular notification and voice note can irritate someone.
- I am saying this because this program sometimes irritates me as well.

## Modules used.
- time
- notification
- os
- pyautogui

# Setting this up for use..

## Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/AnantLuthra/Health-Care-Notifier-System.git
```
- If you want to make it automatically run as you boot you system, so you have to put this file shortcut in you startup folder for that first open run by win + R then type this
```
shell:startup
```
then enter. 
- Then just paste the shortcut of the main file. having .pyw extension. Then from next time as you boot your system it will automatically start run in background and just notify you.
## Pro tip
- If you feel fedup with getting notification and voice notes you can close it by going into task manager > details then find pyw.exe then select that and click on end process. This will close that program, and it will rerun again when you reboot your system next time.
